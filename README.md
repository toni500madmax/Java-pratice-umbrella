# My Java Pratice Projects.
### Is a repository what destinated for all of that projects which were done in Java, i'm a student absolutely beginner level in Java, therefore i decided to separate steps in order to follow my development in this language.
#### Follow the sorting i think it'll be possible to show my development during the course, below:
#### - Each Project File has the name of the project;
#### - Files inside will have the sufix: T<version> for each commit i'll push;
#### - Each File inside i intend to develop new things and improvements;
#### - The final File will have the Complete Back-End software. (I hope for i'll be able);

### I hope for tips and suggestions. See ya!
